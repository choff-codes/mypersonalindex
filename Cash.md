  * If desired, add purchases and sales in the activity section, or choose custom trades.
    * Note that cash always has a share price of $1.00.
  * To enter interest payments, manually add X shares at $0, where X is the amount of interest.  For example, if you received $500 interest for August, enter a purchase of 500 shares at no cost ($0) on 8/31.
  * Click OK.  That's it!
